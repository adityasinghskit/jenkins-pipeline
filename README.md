The repository contains Jenkins pipeline scripts for deploying:

1. **Frontend**: 
   - An Angular App, but will also work for React and Vue Apps with minimal changes.

2. **Backend**: 
   - A Spring Boot project as a microservice in the form of a Docker container.
   - There is another pipeline for the Spring Boot app to deploy it in an AKS Kubernetes cluster.
